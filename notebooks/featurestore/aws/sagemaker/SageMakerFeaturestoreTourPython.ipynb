If the features reside in different featuregroups, the library will also try to infer how to join the features together based on common columns. If the JOIN query cannot be inferred due to existence of multiple features with the same name or non-obvious JOIN query, the user need to supply enough information to the API call to be able to query the featurestore. If the user already knows the JOIN query it can also run featurestore.sql(joinQuery) directly (an example of this is shown further down in this notebook).
